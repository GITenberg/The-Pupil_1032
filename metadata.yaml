description: 'The poor young man hesitated and procrastinated: it cost him such an
  effort to broach the subject of terms, to speak of money to a person who spoke only
  of feelings and, as it were, of the aristocracy. Yet he was unwilling to take leave,
  treating his engagement as settled, without some more conventional glance in that
  direction than he could find and opening for in the manner of the large affable
  lady who sat there drawing a pair of soiled gants de Suede through a fat jewelled
  hand and, at once pressing and gliding, repeated over and over everything but the
  thing he would have liked to hear.'
