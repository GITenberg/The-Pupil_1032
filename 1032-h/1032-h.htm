<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The poor young man hesitated and procrastinated: it cost him
such an effort to broach the subject of terms, to speak of money
to a person who spoke only of feelings and, as it were, of the
aristocracy.&nbsp; Yet he was unwilling to take leave, treating
his engagement as settled, without some more conventional glance
in that direction than he could find an opening for in the manner
of the large affable lady who sat there drawing a pair of soiled
gants de Su&egrave;de through a fat jewelled hand and, at once
pressing and gliding, repeated over and over everything but the
thing he would have liked to hear.&nbsp; He would have liked to
hear the figure of his salary; but just as he was nervously about
to sound that note the little boy came back&mdash;the little boy
Mrs. Moreen had sent out of the room to fetch her fan.&nbsp; He
came back without the fan, only with the casual observation that
he couldn&rsquo;t find it.&nbsp; As he dropped this cynical
confession he looked straight and hard at the candidate for the
honour of taking his education in hand.&nbsp; This personage
reflected somewhat grimly that the thing he should have to teach
his little charge would be to appear to address himself to his
mother when he spoke to her&mdash;especially not to make her such
an improper answer as that.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Moreen bethought herself of this pretext for getting
rid of their companion Pemberton supposed it was precisely to
approach the delicate subject of his remuneration.&nbsp; But it
had been only to say some things about her son that it was better
a boy of eleven shouldn&rsquo;t catch.&nbsp; They were
extravagantly to his advantage save when she lowered her voice to
sigh, tapping her left side familiarly, &ldquo;And all
overclouded by <i>this</i>, you know; all at the mercy of a
weakness&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pemberton gathered that the
weakness was in the region of the heart.&nbsp; He had known the
poor child was not robust: this was the basis on which he had
been invited to treat, through an English lady, an Oxford
acquaintance, then at Nice, who happened to know both his needs
and those of the amiable American family looking out for
something really superior in the way of a resident tutor.</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s impression of his prospective pupil, who
had come into the room as if to see for himself the moment
Pemberton was admitted, was not quite the soft solicitation the
visitor had taken for granted.&nbsp; Morgan Moreen was somehow
sickly without being &ldquo;delicate,&rdquo; and that he looked
intelligent&mdash;it is true Pemberton wouldn&rsquo;t have
enjoyed his being stupid&mdash;only added to the suggestion that,
as with his big mouth and big ears he really couldn&rsquo;t be
called pretty, he might too utterly fail to please.&nbsp;
Pemberton was modest, was even timid; and the chance that his
small scholar might prove cleverer than himself had quite
figured, to his anxiety, among the dangers of an untried
experiment.&nbsp; He reflected, however, that these were risks
one had to run when one accepted a position, as it was called, in
a private family; when as yet one&rsquo;s university honours had,
pecuniarily speaking, remained barren.&nbsp; At any rate when
Mrs. Moreen got up as to intimate that, since it was understood
he would enter upon his duties within the week she would let him
off now, he succeeded, in spite of the presence of the child, in
squeezing out a phrase about the rate of payment.&nbsp; It was
not the fault of the conscious smile which seemed a reference to
the lady&rsquo;s expensive identity, it was not the fault of this
demonstration, which had, in a sort, both vagueness and point, if
the allusion didn&rsquo;t sound rather vulgar.&nbsp; This was
exactly because she became still more gracious to reply:
&ldquo;Oh I can assure you that all that will be quite
regular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pemberton only wondered, while he took up his hat, what
&ldquo;all that&rdquo; was to amount to&mdash;people had such
different ideas.&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen&rsquo;s words, however, seemed
to commit the family to a pledge definite enough to elicit from
the child a strange little comment in the shape of the mocking
foreign ejaculation &ldquo;Oh la-la!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pemberton, in some confusion, glanced at him as he walked
slowly to the window with his back turned, his hands in his
pockets and the air in his elderly shoulders of a boy who
didn&rsquo;t play.&nbsp; The young man wondered if he should be
able to teach him to play, though his mother had said it would
never do and that this was why school was impossible.&nbsp; Mrs.
Moreen exhibited no discomfiture; she only continued blandly:
&ldquo;Mr. Moreen will be delighted to meet your wishes.&nbsp; As
I told you, he has been called to London for a week.&nbsp; As
soon as he comes back you shall have it out with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was so frank and friendly that the young man could only
reply, laughing as his hostess laughed: &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t
imagine we shall have much of a battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll give you anything you like,&rdquo; the
boy remarked unexpectedly, returning from the window.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind what anything costs&mdash;we live
awfully well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, you&rsquo;re too quaint!&rdquo; his mother
exclaimed, putting out to caress him a practised but ineffectual
hand.&nbsp; He slipped out of it, but looked with intelligent
innocent eyes at Pemberton, who had already had time to notice
that from one moment to the other his small satiric face seemed
to change its time of life.&nbsp; At this moment it was
infantine, yet it appeared also to be under the influence of
curious intuitions and knowledges.&nbsp; Pemberton rather
disliked precocity and was disappointed to find gleams of it in a
disciple not yet in his teens.&nbsp; Nevertheless he divined on
the spot that Morgan wouldn&rsquo;t prove a bore.&nbsp; He would
prove on the contrary a source of agitation.&nbsp; This idea held
the young man, in spite of a certain repulsion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pompous little person!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not
extravagant!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen gaily protested, making
another unsuccessful attempt to draw the boy to her side.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must know what to expect,&rdquo; she went on to
Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less you expect the better!&rdquo; her companion
interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we <i>are</i> people of
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only so far as <i>you</i> make us so!&rdquo; Mrs.
Moreen tenderly mocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well then, on
Friday&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re
superstitious&mdash;and mind you don&rsquo;t fail us.&nbsp; Then
you&rsquo;ll see us all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so sorry the girls are
out.&nbsp; I guess you&rsquo;ll like the girls.&nbsp; And, you
know, I&rsquo;ve another son, quite different from this
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tries to imitate me,&rdquo; Morgan said to their
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tries?&nbsp; Why he&rsquo;s twenty years old!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Moreen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very witty,&rdquo; Pemberton remarked to
the child&mdash;a proposition his mother echoed with enthusiasm,
declaring Morgan&rsquo;s sallies to be the delight of the
house.</p>
<p>The boy paid no heed to this; he only enquired abruptly of the
visitor, who was surprised afterwards that he hadn&rsquo;t struck
him as offensively forward: &ldquo;Do you <i>want</i> very much
to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you doubt it after such a description of what I
shall hear?&rdquo; Pemberton replied.&nbsp; Yet he didn&rsquo;t
want to come at all; he was coming because he had to go
somewhere, thanks to the collapse of his fortune at the end of a
year abroad spent on the system of putting his scant patrimony
into a single full wave of experience.&nbsp; He had had his full
wave but couldn&rsquo;t pay the score at his inn.&nbsp; Moreover
he had caught in the boy&rsquo;s eyes the glimpse of a far-off
appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do the best I can for you,&rdquo; said
Morgan; with which he turned away again.&nbsp; He passed out of
one of the long windows; Pemberton saw him go and lean on the
parapet of the terrace.&nbsp; He remained there while the young
man took leave of his mother, who, on Pemberton&rsquo;s looking
as if he expected a farewell from him, interposed with:
&ldquo;Leave him, leave him; he&rsquo;s so strange!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pemberton supposed her to fear something he might say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a genius&mdash;you&rsquo;ll love him,&rdquo;
she added.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s much the most interesting
person in the family.&rdquo;&nbsp; And before he could invent
some civility to oppose to this she wound up with: &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;re all good, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a genius&mdash;you&rsquo;ll love him!&rdquo;
were words that recurred to our aspirant before the Friday,
suggesting among many things that geniuses were not invariably
loveable.&nbsp; However, it was all the better if there was an
element that would make tutorship absorbing: he had perhaps taken
too much for granted it would only disgust him.&nbsp; As he left
the villa after his interview he looked up at the balcony and saw
the child leaning over it.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall have great
larks!&rdquo; he called up.</p>
<p>Morgan hung fire a moment and then gaily returned: &ldquo;By
the time you come back I shall have thought of something
witty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made Pemberton say to himself &ldquo;After all he&rsquo;s
rather nice.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>On the Friday he saw them all, as Mrs. Moreen had promised,
for her husband had come back and the girls and the other son
were at home.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen had a white moustache, a confiding
manner and, in his buttonhole, the ribbon of a foreign
order&mdash;bestowed, as Pemberton eventually learned, for
services.&nbsp; For what services he never clearly ascertained:
this was a point&mdash;one of a large number&mdash;that Mr.
Moreen&rsquo;s manner never confided.&nbsp; What it emphatically
did confide was that he was even more a man of the world than you
might first make out.&nbsp; Ulick, the firstborn, was in visible
training for the same profession&mdash;under the disadvantage as
yet, however, of a buttonhole but feebly floral and a moustache
with no pretensions to type.&nbsp; The girls had hair and figures
and manners and small fat feet, but had never been out
alone.&nbsp; As for Mrs. Moreen Pemberton saw on a nearer view
that her elegance was intermittent and her parts didn&rsquo;t
always match.&nbsp; Her husband, as she had promised, met with
enthusiasm Pemberton&rsquo;s ideas in regard to a salary.&nbsp;
The young man had endeavoured to keep these stammerings modest,
and Mr. Moreen made it no secret that <i>he</i> found them
wanting in &ldquo;style.&rdquo;&nbsp; He further mentioned that
he aspired to be intimate with his children, to be their best
friend, and that he was always looking out for them.&nbsp; That
was what he went off for, to London and other places&mdash;to
look out; and this vigilance was the theory of life, as well as
the real occupation, of the whole family.&nbsp; They all looked
out, for they were very frank on the subject of its being
necessary.&nbsp; They desired it to be understood that they were
earnest people, and also that their fortune, though quite
adequate for earnest people, required the most careful
administration.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen, as the parent bird, sought
sustenance for the nest.&nbsp; Ulick invoked support mainly at
the club, where Pemberton guessed that it was usually served on
green cloth.&nbsp; The girls used to do up their hair and their
frocks themselves, and our young man felt appealed to to be glad,
in regard to Morgan&rsquo;s education, that, though it must
naturally be of the best, it didn&rsquo;t cost too much.&nbsp;
After a little he <i>was</i> glad, forgetting at times his own
needs in the interest inspired by the child&rsquo;s character and
culture and the pleasure of making easy terms for him.</p>
<p>During the first weeks of their acquaintance Morgan had been
as puzzling as a page in an unknown language&mdash;altogether
different from the obvious little Anglo-Saxons who had
misrepresented childhood to Pemberton.&nbsp; Indeed the whole
mystic volume in which the boy had been amateurishly bound
demanded some practice in translation.&nbsp; To-day, after a
considerable interval, there is something phantasmagoria, like a
prismatic reflexion or a serial novel, in Pemberton&rsquo;s
memory of the queerness of the Moreens.&nbsp; If it were not for
a few tangible tokens&mdash;a lock of Morgan&rsquo;s hair cut by
his own hand, and the half-dozen letters received from him when
they were disjoined&mdash;the whole episode and the figures
peopling it would seem too inconsequent for anything but
dreamland.&nbsp; Their supreme quaintness was their
success&mdash;as it appeared to him for a while at the time;
since he had never seen a family so brilliantly equipped for
failure.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it success to have kept him so
hatefully long?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it success to have drawn him
in that first morning at d&eacute;jeuner, the Friday he
came&mdash;it was enough to <i>make</i> one
superstitious&mdash;so that he utterly committed himself, and
this not by calculation or on a signal, but from a happy instinct
which made them, like a band of gipsies, work so neatly
together?&nbsp; They amused him as much as if they had really
been a band of gipsies.&nbsp; He was still young and had not seen
much of the world&mdash;his English years had been properly arid;
therefore the reversed conventions of the Moreens&mdash;for they
had <i>their</i> desperate proprieties&mdash;struck him as
topsy-turvy.&nbsp; He had encountered nothing like them at
Oxford; still less had any such note been struck to his younger
American ear during the four years at Yale in which he had richly
supposed himself to be reacting against a Puritan strain.&nbsp;
The reaction of the Moreens, at any rate, went ever so much
further.&nbsp; He had thought himself very sharp that first day
in hitting them all off in his mind with the
&ldquo;cosmopolite&rdquo; label.&nbsp; Later it seemed feeble and
colourless&mdash;confessedly helplessly provisional.</p>
<p>He yet when he first applied it felt a glow of joy&mdash;for
an instructor he was still empirical&mdash;rise from the
apprehension that living with them would really be to see
life.&nbsp; Their sociable strangeness was an intimation of
that&mdash;their chatter of tongues, their gaiety and good
humour, their infinite dawdling (they were always getting
themselves up, but it took forever, and Pemberton had once found
Mr. Moreen shaving in the drawing-room), their French, their
Italian and, cropping up in the foreign fluencies, their cold
tough slices of American.&nbsp; They lived on macaroni and
coffee&mdash;they had these articles prepared in
perfection&mdash;but they knew recipes for a hundred other
dishes.&nbsp; They overflowed with music and song, were always
humming and catching each other up, and had a sort of
professional acquaintance with Continental cities.&nbsp; They
talked of &ldquo;good places&rdquo; as if they had been
pickpockets or strolling players.&nbsp; They had at Nice a villa,
a carriage, a piano and a banjo, and they went to official
parties.&nbsp; They were a perfect calendar of the
&ldquo;days&rdquo; of their friends, which Pemberton knew them,
when they were indisposed, to get out of bed to go to, and which
made the week larger than life when Mrs. Moreen talked of them
with Paula and Amy.&nbsp; Their initiations gave their new inmate
at first an almost dazzling sense of culture.&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen
had translated something at some former period&mdash;an author
whom it made Pemberton feel born&eacute; never to have heard
of.&nbsp; They could imitate Venetian and sing Neapolitan, and
when they wanted to say something very particular communicated
with each other in an ingenious dialect of their own, an elastic
spoken cipher which Pemberton at first took for some patois of
one of their countries, but which he &ldquo;caught on to&rdquo;
as he would not have grasped provincial development of Spanish or
German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the family
language&mdash;Ultramoreen,&rdquo; Morgan explained to him drolly
enough; but the boy rarely condescended to use it himself, though
he dealt in colloquial Latin as if he had been a little
prelate.</p>
<p>Among all the &ldquo;days&rdquo; with which Mrs.
Moreen&rsquo;s memory was taxed she managed to squeeze in one of
her own, which her friends sometimes forgot.&nbsp; But the house
drew a frequented air from the number of fine people who were
freely named there and from several mysterious men with foreign
titles and English clothes whom Morgan called the princes and
who, on sofas with the girls, talked French very
loud&mdash;though sometimes with some oddity of accent&mdash;as
if to show they were saying nothing improper.&nbsp; Pemberton
wondered how the princes could ever propose in that tone and so
publicly: he took for granted cynically that this was what was
desired of them.&nbsp; Then he recognised that even for the
chance of such an advantage Mrs. Moreen would never allow Paula
and Amy to receive alone.&nbsp; These young ladies were not at
all timid, but it was just the safeguards that made them so
candidly free.&nbsp; It was a houseful of Bohemians who wanted
tremendously to be Philistines.</p>
<p>In one respect, however, certainly they achieved no
rigour&mdash;they were wonderfully amiable and ecstatic about
Morgan.&nbsp; It was a genuine tenderness, an artless admiration,
equally strong in each.&nbsp; They even praised his beauty, which
was small, and were as afraid of him as if they felt him of finer
clay.&nbsp; They spoke of him as a little angel and a
prodigy&mdash;they touched on his want of health with long vague
faces.&nbsp; Pemberton feared at first an extravagance that might
make him hate the boy, but before this happened he had become
extravagant himself.&nbsp; Later, when he had grown rather to
hate the others, it was a bribe to patience for him that they
were at any rate nice about Morgan, going on tiptoe if they
fancied he was showing symptoms, and even giving up
somebody&rsquo;s &ldquo;day&rdquo; to procure him a
pleasure.&nbsp; Mixed with this too was the oddest wish to make
him independent, as if they had felt themselves not good enough
for him.&nbsp; They passed him over to the new members of their
circle very much as if wishing to force some charity of adoption
on so free an agent and get rid of their own charge.&nbsp; They
were delighted when they saw Morgan take so to his kind
playfellow, and could think of no higher praise for the young
man.&nbsp; It was strange how they contrived to reconcile the
appearance, and indeed the essential fact, of adoring the child
with their eagerness to wash their hands of him.&nbsp; Did they
want to get rid of him before he should find them out?&nbsp;
Pemberton was finding them out month by month.&nbsp; The
boy&rsquo;s fond family, however this might be, turned their
backs with exaggerated delicacy, as if to avoid the reproach of
interfering.&nbsp; Seeing in time how little he had in common
with them&mdash;it was by <i>them</i> he first observed it; they
proclaimed it with complete humility&mdash;his companion was
moved to speculate on the mysteries of transmission, the far
jumps of heredity.&nbsp; Where his detachment from most of the
things they represented had come from was more than an observer
could say&mdash;it certainly had burrowed under two or three
generations.</p>
<p>As for Pemberton&rsquo;s own estimate of his pupil, it was a
good while before he got the point of view, so little had he been
prepared for it by the smug young barbarians to whom the
tradition of tutorship, as hitherto revealed to him, had been
adjusted.&nbsp; Morgan was scrappy and surprising, deficient in
many properties supposed common to the genus and abounding in
others that were the portion only of the supernaturally
clever.&nbsp; One day his friend made a great stride: it cleared
up the question to perceive that Morgan <i>was</i> supernaturally
clever and that, though the formula was temporarily meagre, this
would be the only assumption on which one could successfully deal
with him.&nbsp; He had the general quality of a child for whom
life had not been simplified by school, a kind of homebred
sensibility which might have been as bad for himself but was
charming for others, and a whole range of refinement and
perception&mdash;little musical vibrations as taking as picked-up
airs&mdash;begotten by wandering about Europe at the tail of his
migratory tribe.&nbsp; This might not have been an education to
recommend in advance, but its results with so special a subject
were as appreciable as the marks on a piece of fine
porcelain.&nbsp; There was at the same time in him a small strain
of stoicism, doubtless the fruit of having had to begin early to
bear pain, which counted for pluck and made it of less
consequence that he might have been thought at school rather a
polyglot little beast.&nbsp; Pemberton indeed quickly found
himself rejoicing that school was out of the question: in any
million of boys it was probably good for all but one, and Morgan
was that millionth.&nbsp; It would have made him comparative and
superior&mdash;it might have made him really require
kicking.&nbsp; Pemberton would try to be school himself&mdash;a
bigger seminary than five hundred grazing donkeys, so that,
winning no prizes, the boy would remain unconscious and
irresponsible and amusing&mdash;amusing, because, though life was
already intense in his childish nature, freshness still made
there a strong draught for jokes.&nbsp; It turned out that even
in the still air of Morgan&rsquo;s various disabilities jokes
flourished greatly.&nbsp; He was a pale lean acute undeveloped
little cosmopolite, who liked intellectual gymnastics and who
also, as regards the behaviour of mankind, had noticed more
things than you might suppose, but who nevertheless had his
proper playroom of superstitions, where he smashed a dozen toys a
day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>At Nice once, toward evening, as the pair rested in the open
air after a walk, and looked over the sea at the pink western
lights, he said suddenly to his comrade: &ldquo;Do you like it,
you know&mdash;being with us all in this intimate way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, why should I stay if I
didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;ll stay?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m almost
sure you won&rsquo;t, very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to dismiss me,&rdquo; said
Pemberton.</p>
<p>Morgan debated, looking at the sunset.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think if
I did right I ought to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know I&rsquo;m supposed to instruct you in
virtue; but in that case don&rsquo;t do right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;re very
young&mdash;fortunately,&rdquo; Morgan went on, turning to him
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, compared with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore it won&rsquo;t matter so much if you do lose
a lot of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to look at it,&rdquo; said
Pemberton accommodatingly.</p>
<p>They were silent a minute; after which the boy asked:
&ldquo;Do you like my father and my mother very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, yes.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re charming
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan received this with another silence; then unexpectedly,
familiarly, but at the same time affectionately, he remarked:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a jolly old humbug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a particular reason the words made our young man change
colour.&nbsp; The boy noticed in an instant that he had turned
red, whereupon he turned red himself and pupil and master
exchanged a longish glance in which there was a consciousness of
many more things than are usually touched upon, even tacitly, in
such a relation.&nbsp; It produced for Pemberton an
embarrassment; it raised in a shadowy form a question&mdash;this
was the first glimpse of it&mdash;destined to play a singular
and, as he imagined, owing to the altogether peculiar conditions,
an unprecedented part in his intercourse with his little
companion.&nbsp; Later, when he found himself talking with the
youngster in a way in which few youngsters could ever have been
talked with, he thought of that clumsy moment on the bench at
Nice as the dawn of an understanding that had broadened.&nbsp;
What had added to the clumsiness then was that he thought it his
duty to declare to Morgan that he might abuse him, Pemberton, as
much as he liked, but must never abuse his parents.&nbsp; To this
Morgan had the easy retort that he hadn&rsquo;t dreamed of
abusing them; which appeared to be true: it put Pemberton in the
wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why am I a humbug for saying <i>I</i> think them
charming?&rdquo; the young man asked, conscious of a certain
rashness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;they&rsquo;re not your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They love you better than anything in the
world&mdash;never forget that,&rdquo; said Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that why you like them so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very kind to me,&rdquo; Pemberton replied
evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a humbug!&rdquo; laughed Morgan, passing
an arm into his tutor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He leaned against him
looking oft at the sea again and swinging his long thin legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kick my shins,&rdquo; said Pemberton while
he reflected &ldquo;Hang it, I can&rsquo;t complain of them to
the child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another reason, too,&rdquo; Morgan went
on, keeping his legs still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another reason for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides their not being your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said
Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will before long.&nbsp; All right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did understand fully before long, but he made a fight even
with himself before he confessed it.&nbsp; He thought it the
oddest thing to have a struggle with the child about.&nbsp; He
wondered he didn&rsquo;t hate the hope of the Moreens for
bringing the struggle on.&nbsp; But by the time it began any such
sentiment for that scion was closed to him.&nbsp; Morgan was a
special case, and to know him was to accept him on his own odd
terms.&nbsp; Pemberton had spent his aversion to special cases
before arriving at knowledge.&nbsp; When at last he did arrive
his quandary was great.&nbsp; Against every interest he had
attached himself.&nbsp; They would have to meet things
together.&nbsp; Before they went home that evening at Nice the
boy had said, clinging to his arm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate you&rsquo;ll hang on to the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till you&rsquo;re fairly beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> ought to be fairly beaten!&rdquo; cried the
young man, drawing him closer.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>A year after he had come to live with them Mr. and Mrs. Moreen
suddenly gave up the villa at Nice.&nbsp; Pemberton had got used
to suddenness, having seen it practised on a considerable scale
during two jerky little tours&mdash;one in Switzerland the first
summer, and the other late in the winter, when they all ran down
to Florence and then, at the end of ten days, liking it much less
than they had intended, straggled back in mysterious
depression.&nbsp; They had returned to Nice &ldquo;for
ever,&rdquo; as they said; but this didn&rsquo;t prevent their
squeezing, one rainy muggy May night, into a second-class
railway-carriage&mdash;you could never tell by which class they
would travel&mdash;where Pemberton helped them to stow away a
wonderful collection of bundles and bags.&nbsp; The explanation
of this man&oelig;uvre was that they had determined to spend the
summer &ldquo;in some bracing place&rdquo;; but in Paris they
dropped into a small furnished apartment&mdash;a fourth floor in
a third-rate avenue, where there was a smell on the staircase and
the portier was hateful&mdash;and passed the next four months in
blank indigence.</p>
<p>The better part of this baffled sojourn was for the preceptor
and his pupil, who, visiting the Invalides and Notre Dame, the
Conciergerie and all the museums, took a hundred remunerative
rambles.&nbsp; They learned to know their Paris, which was
useful, for they came back another year for a longer stay, the
general character of which in Pemberton&rsquo;s memory to-day
mixes pitiably and confusedly with that of the first.&nbsp; He
sees Morgan&rsquo;s shabby knickerbockers&mdash;the everlasting
pair that didn&rsquo;t match his blouse and that as he grew
longer could only grow faded.&nbsp; He remembers the particular
holes in his three or four pair of coloured stockings.</p>
<p>Morgan was dear to his mother, but he never was better dressed
than was absolutely necessary&mdash;partly, no doubt, by his own
fault, for he was as indifferent to his appearance as a German
philosopher.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear fellow, you <i>are</i> coming
to pieces,&rdquo; Pemberton would say to him in sceptical
remonstrance; to which the child would reply, looking at him
serenely up and down: &ldquo;My dear fellow, so are you!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to cast you in the shade.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pemberton
could have no rejoinder for this&mdash;the assertion so closely
represented the fact.&nbsp; If however the deficiencies of his
own wardrobe were a chapter by themselves he didn&rsquo;t like
his little charge to look too poor.&nbsp; Later he used to say
&ldquo;Well, if we&rsquo;re poor, why, after all, shouldn&rsquo;t
we look it?&rdquo; and he consoled himself with thinking there
was something rather elderly and gentlemanly in Morgan&rsquo;s
disrepair&mdash;it differed from the untidiness of the urchin who
plays and spoils his things.&nbsp; He could trace perfectly the
degrees by which, in proportion as her little son confined
himself to his tutor for society, Mrs. Moreen shrewdly forbore to
renew his garments.&nbsp; She did nothing that didn&rsquo;t show,
neglected him because he escaped notice, and then, as he
illustrated this clever policy, discouraged at home his public
appearances.&nbsp; Her position was logical enough&mdash;those
members of her family who did show had to be showy.</p>
<p>During this period and several others Pemberton was quite
aware of how he and his comrade might strike people; wandering
languidly through the Jardin des Plantes as if they had nowhere
to go, sitting on the winter days in the galleries of the Louvre,
so splendidly ironical to the homeless, as if for the advantage
of the calorif&egrave;re.&nbsp; They joked about it sometimes: it
was the sort of joke that was perfectly within the boy&rsquo;s
compass.&nbsp; They figured themselves as part of the vast vague
hand-to-mouth multitude of the enormous city and pretended they
were proud of their position in it&mdash;it showed them
&ldquo;such a lot of life&rdquo; and made them conscious of a
democratic brotherhood.&nbsp; If Pemberton couldn&rsquo;t feel a
sympathy in destitution with his small companion&mdash;for after
all Morgan&rsquo;s fond parents would never have let him really
suffer&mdash;the boy would at least feel it with him, so it came
to the same thing.&nbsp; He used sometimes to wonder what people
would think they were&mdash;to fancy they were looked askance at,
as if it might be a suspected case of kidnapping.&nbsp; Morgan
wouldn&rsquo;t be taken for a young patrician with a
preceptor&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t smart enough; though he might
pass for his companion&rsquo;s sickly little brother.&nbsp; Now
and then he had a five-franc piece, and except once, when they
bought a couple of lovely neckties, one of which he made
Pemberton accept, they laid it out scientifically in old
books.&nbsp; This was sure to be a great day, always spent on the
quays, in a rummage of the dusty boxes that garnish the
parapets.&nbsp; Such occasions helped them to live, for their
books ran low very soon after the beginning of their
acquaintance.&nbsp; Pemberton had a good many in England, but he
was obliged to write to a friend and ask him kindly to get some
fellow to give him something for them.</p>
<p>If they had to relinquish that summer the advantage of the
bracing climate the young man couldn&rsquo;t but suspect this
failure of the cup when at their very lips to have been the
effect of a rude jostle of his own.&nbsp; This had represented
his first blow-out, as he called it, with his patrons; his first
successful attempt&mdash;though there was little other success
about it&mdash;to bring them to a consideration of his impossible
position.&nbsp; As the ostensible eve of a costly journey the
moment had struck him as favourable to an earnest protest, the
presentation of an ultimatum.&nbsp; Ridiculous as it sounded, he
had never yet been able to compass an uninterrupted private
interview with the elder pair or with either of them
singly.&nbsp; They were always flanked by their elder children,
and poor Pemberton usually had his own little charge at his
side.&nbsp; He was conscious of its being a house in which the
surface of one&rsquo;s delicacy got rather smudged; nevertheless
he had preserved the bloom of his scruple against announcing to
Mr. and Mrs. Moreen with publicity that he shouldn&rsquo;t be
able to go on longer without a little money.&nbsp; He was still
simple enough to suppose Ulick and Paula and Amy might not know
that since his arrival he had only had a hundred and forty
francs; and he was magnanimous enough to wish not to compromise
their parents in their eyes.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen now listened to
him, as he listened to every one and to every thing, like a man
of the world, and seemed to appeal to him&mdash;though not of
course too grossly&mdash;to try and be a little more of one
himself.&nbsp; Pemberton recognised in fact the importance of the
character&mdash;from the advantage it gave Mr. Moreen.&nbsp; He
was not even confused or embarrassed, whereas the young man in
his service was more so than there was any reason for.&nbsp;
Neither was he surprised&mdash;at least any more than a gentleman
had to be who freely confessed himself a little
shocked&mdash;though not perhaps strictly at Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go into this, mustn&rsquo;t we, dear?&rdquo; he
said to his wife.&nbsp; He assured his young friend that the
matter should have his very best attention; and he melted into
space as elusively as if, at the door, he were taking an
inevitable but deprecatory precedence.&nbsp; When, the next
moment, Pemberton found himself alone with Mrs. Moreen it was to
hear her say &ldquo;I see, I see&rdquo;&mdash;stroking the
roundness of her chin and looking as if she were only hesitating
between a dozen easy remedies.&nbsp; If they didn&rsquo;t make
their push Mr. Moreen could at least disappear for several
days.&nbsp; During his absence his wife took up the subject again
spontaneously, but her contribution to it was merely that she had
thought all the while they were getting on so beautifully.&nbsp;
Pemberton&rsquo;s reply to this revelation was that unless they
immediately put down something on account he would leave them on
the spot and for ever.&nbsp; He knew she would wonder how he
would get away, and for a moment expected her to enquire.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t, for which he was almost grateful to her, so
little was he in a position to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, you <i>know</i> you
won&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;re too interested,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are interested, you know you are, you dear
kind man!&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed with almost condemnatory
archness, as if it were a reproach&mdash;though she
wouldn&rsquo;t insist; and flirted a soiled pocket-handkerchief
at him.</p>
<p>Pemberton&rsquo;s mind was fully made up to take his step the
following week.&nbsp; This would give him time to get an answer
to a letter he had despatched to England.&nbsp; If he did in the
event nothing of the sort&mdash;that is if he stayed another year
and then went away only for three months&mdash;it was not merely
because before the answer to his letter came (most unsatisfactory
when it did arrive) Mr. Moreen generously counted out to him, and
again with the sacrifice to &ldquo;form&rdquo; of a marked man of
the world, three hundred francs in elegant ringing gold.&nbsp; He
was irritated to find that Mrs. Moreen was right, that he
couldn&rsquo;t at the pinch bear to leave the child.&nbsp; This
stood out clearer for the very reason that, the night of his
desperate appeal to his patrons, he had seen fully for the first
time where he was.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it another proof of the
success with which those patrons practised their arts that they
had managed to avert for so long the illuminating flash?&nbsp; It
descended on our friend with a breadth of effect which perhaps
would have struck a spectator as comical, after he had returned
to his little servile room, which looked into a close court where
a bare dirty opposite wall took, with the sound of shrill
clatter, the reflexion of lighted back windows.&nbsp; He had
simply given himself away to a band of adventurers.&nbsp; The
idea, the word itself, wore a romantic horror for him&mdash;he
had always lived on such safe lines.&nbsp; Later it assumed a
more interesting, almost a soothing, sense: it pointed a moral,
and Pemberton could enjoy a moral.&nbsp; The Moreens were
adventurers not merely because they didn&rsquo;t pay their debts,
because they lived on society, but because their whole view of
life, dim and confused and instinctive, like that of clever
colour-blind animals, was speculative and rapacious and
mean.&nbsp; Oh they were &ldquo;respectable,&rdquo; and that only
made them more immondes.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s analysis,
while he brooded, put it at last very simply&mdash;they were
adventurers because they were toadies and snobs.&nbsp; That was
the completest account of them&mdash;it was the law of their
being.&nbsp; Even when this truth became vivid to their ingenious
inmate he remained unconscious of how much his mind had been
prepared for it by the extraordinary little boy who had now
become such a complication in his life.&nbsp; Much less could he
then calculate on the information he was still to owe the
extraordinary little boy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>But it was during the ensuing time that the real problem came
up&mdash;the problem of how far it was excusable to discuss the
turpitude of parents with a child of twelve, of thirteen, of
fourteen.&nbsp; Absolutely inexcusable and quite impossible it of
course at first appeared; and indeed the question didn&rsquo;t
press for some time after Pemberton had received his three
hundred francs.&nbsp; They produced a temporary lull, a relief
from the sharpest pressure.&nbsp; The young man frugally amended
his wardrobe and even had a few francs in his pocket.&nbsp; He
thought the Moreens looked at him as if he were almost too smart,
as if they ought to take care not to spoil him.&nbsp; If Mr.
Moreen hadn&rsquo;t been such a man of the world he would perhaps
have spoken of the freedom of such neckties on the part of a
subordinate.&nbsp; But Mr. Moreen was always enough a man of the
world to let things pass&mdash;he had certainly shown that.&nbsp;
It was singular how Pemberton guessed that Morgan, though saying
nothing about it, knew something had happened.&nbsp; But three
hundred francs, especially when one owed money, couldn&rsquo;t
last for ever; and when the treasure was gone&mdash;the boy knew
when it had failed&mdash;Morgan did break ground.&nbsp; The party
had returned to Nice at the beginning of the winter, but not to
the charming villa.&nbsp; They went to an hotel, where they
stayed three months, and then moved to another establishment,
explaining that they had left the first because, after waiting
and waiting, they couldn&rsquo;t get the rooms they wanted.&nbsp;
These apartments, the rooms they wanted, were generally very
splendid; but fortunately they never <i>could</i> get
them&mdash;fortunately, I mean, for Pemberton, who reflected
always that if they had got them there would have been a still
scantier educational fund.&nbsp; What Morgan said at last was
said suddenly, irrelevantly, when the moment came, in the middle
of a lesson, and consisted of the apparently unfeeling words:
&ldquo;You ought to filer, you know&mdash;you really
ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pemberton stared.&nbsp; He had learnt enough French slang from
Morgan to know that to filer meant to cut sticks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah
my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t turn me off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan pulled a Greek lexicon toward him&mdash;he used a
Greek-German&mdash;to look out a word, instead of asking it of
Pemberton.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go on like this, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know they don&rsquo;t pay you up,&rdquo; said
Morgan, blushing and turning his leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay me?&rdquo; Pemberton stared again and
feigned amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;What on earth put that into your
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been there a long time,&rdquo; the boy replied
rummaging his book.</p>
<p>Pemberton was silent, then he went on: &ldquo;I say, what are
you hunting for?&nbsp; They pay me beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hunting for the Greek for awful
whopper,&rdquo; Morgan dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find that rather for gross impertinence and disabuse
your mind.&nbsp; What do I want of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s another question!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pemberton wavered&mdash;he was drawn in different ways.&nbsp;
The severely correct thing would have been to tell the boy that
such a matter was none of his business and bid him go on with his
lines.&nbsp; But they were really too intimate for that; it was
not the way he was in the habit of treating him; there had been
no reason it should be.&nbsp; On the other hand Morgan had quite
lighted on the truth&mdash;he really shouldn&rsquo;t be able to
keep it up much longer; therefore why not let him know
one&rsquo;s real motive for forsaking him?&nbsp; At the same time
it wasn&rsquo;t decent to abuse to one&rsquo;s pupil the family
of one&rsquo;s pupil; it was better to misrepresent than to do
that.&nbsp; So in reply to his comrade&rsquo;s last exclamation
he just declared, to dismiss the subject, that he had received
several payments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;I say!&rdquo; the boy ejaculated,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Pemberton
insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me your written rendering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan pushed a copybook across the table, and he began to
read the page, but with something running in his head that made
it no sense.&nbsp; Looking up after a minute or two he found the
child&rsquo;s eyes fixed on him and felt in them something
strange.&nbsp; Then Morgan said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of
the stern reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet seen the thing you <i>are</i>
afraid of&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do you that justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This came out with a jump&mdash;it was perfectly
true&mdash;and evidently gave Morgan pleasure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it a long time,&rdquo; he presently
resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t think of it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy appeared to comply, and they had a comfortable and
even an amusing hour.&nbsp; They had a theory that they were very
thorough, and yet they seemed always to be in the amusing part of
lessons, the intervals between the dull dark tunnels, where there
were waysides and jolly views.&nbsp; Yet the morning was brought
to a violent as end by Morgan&rsquo;s suddenly leaning his arms
on the table, burying his head in them and bursting into tears:
at which Pemberton was the more startled that, as it then came
over him, it was the first time he had ever seen the boy cry and
that the impression was consequently quite awful.</p>
<p>The next day, after much thought, he took a decision and,
believing it to be just, immediately acted on it.&nbsp; He
cornered Mr. and Mrs. Moreen again and let them know that if on
the spot they didn&rsquo;t pay him all they owed him he
wouldn&rsquo;t only leave their house but would tell Morgan
exactly what had brought him to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> told him?&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Moreen with a pacifying hand on her well-dressed bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without warning you?&nbsp; For what do you take
me?&rdquo; the young man returned.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Moreen looked at each other; he could see that
they appreciated, as tending to their security, his superstition
of delicacy, and yet that there was a certain alarm in their
relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; Mr. Moreen demanded,
&ldquo;what use can you have, leading the quiet life we all do,
for such a lot of money?&rdquo;&mdash;a question to which
Pemberton made no answer, occupied as he was in noting that what
passed in the mind of his patrons was something like: &ldquo;Oh
then, if we&rsquo;ve felt that the child, dear little angel, has
judged us and how he regards us, and we haven&rsquo;t been
betrayed, he must have guessed&mdash;and in short it&rsquo;s
<i>general</i>!&rdquo; an inference that rather stirred up Mr.
and Mrs. Moreen, as Pemberton had desired it should.&nbsp; At the
same time, if he had supposed his threat would do something
towards bringing them round, he was disappointed to find them
taking for granted&mdash;how vulgar their perception <i>had</i>
been!&mdash;that he had already given them away.&nbsp; There was
a mystic uneasiness in their parental breasts, and that had been
the inferior sense of it.&nbsp; None the less however, his threat
did touch them; for if they had escaped it was only to meet a new
danger.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen appealed to him, on every precedent, as
a man of the world; but his wife had recourse, for the first time
since his domestication with them, to a fine hauteur, reminding
him that a devoted mother, with her child, had arts that
protected her against gross misrepresentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should misrepresent you grossly if I accused you of
common honesty!&rdquo; our friend replied; but as he closed the
door behind him sharply, thinking he had not done himself much
good, while Mr. Moreen lighted another cigarette, he heard his
hostess shout after him more touchingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you do, you <i>do</i>, put the knife to one&rsquo;s
throat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, very early, she came to his room.&nbsp; He
recognised her knock, but had no hope she brought him money; as
to which he was wrong, for she had fifty francs in her
hand.&nbsp; She squeezed forward in her dressing-gown, and he
received her in his own, between his bath-tub and his bed.&nbsp;
He had been tolerably schooled by this time to the &ldquo;foreign
ways&rdquo; of his hosts.&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen was ardent, and when
she was ardent she didn&rsquo;t care what she did; so she now sat
down on his bed, his clothes being on the chairs, and, in her
preoccupation, forgot, as she glanced round, to be ashamed of
giving him such a horrid room.&nbsp; What Mrs. Moreen&rsquo;s
ardour now bore upon was the design of persuading him that in the
first place she was very good-natured to bring him fifty francs,
and that in the second, if he would only see it, he was really
too absurd to expect to be paid.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he paid
enough without perpetual money&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t he paid by the
comfortable luxurious home he enjoyed with them all, without a
care, an anxiety, a solitary want?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he sure of
his position, and wasn&rsquo;t that everything to a young man
like him, quite unknown, with singularly little to show, the
ground of whose exorbitant pretensions it had never been easy to
discover?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he paid above all by the sweet
relation he had established with Morgan&mdash;quite ideal as from
master to pupil&mdash;and by the simple privilege of knowing and
living with so amazingly gifted a child; than whom really (and
she meant literally what she said) there was no better company in
Europe?&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen herself took to appealing to him as a
man of the world; she said &ldquo;Voyons, mon cher,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;My dear man, look here now&rdquo;; and urged him to be
reasonable, putting it before him that it was truly a chance for
him.&nbsp; She spoke as if, according as he <i>should</i> be
reasonable, he would prove himself worthy to be her son&rsquo;s
tutor and of the extraordinary confidence they had placed in
him.</p>
<p>After all, Pemberton reflected, it was only a difference of
theory and the theory didn&rsquo;t matter much.&nbsp; They had
hitherto gone on that of remunerated, as now they would go on
that of gratuitous, service; but why should they have so many
words about it?&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen at all events continued to be
convincing; sitting there with her fifty francs she talked and
reiterated, as women reiterate, and bored and irritated him,
while he leaned against the wall with his hands in the pockets of
his wrapper, drawing it together round his legs and looking over
the head of his visitor at the grey negations of his
window.&nbsp; She wound up with saying: &ldquo;You see I bring
you a definite proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A definite proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make our relations regular, as it were&mdash;to put
them on a comfortable footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;it&rsquo;s a system,&rdquo; said
Pemberton.&nbsp; &ldquo;A kind of organised blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moreen bounded up, which was exactly what he
wanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You practise on one&rsquo;s fears&mdash;one&rsquo;s
fears about the child if one should go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray what would happen to him in that event?&rdquo;
she demanded, with majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he&rsquo;d be alone with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray with whom <i>should</i> a child be but with
those whom he loves most?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think that, why don&rsquo;t you dismiss
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you pretend he loves you more than he loves
<i>us</i>?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Moreen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he ought to.&nbsp; I make sacrifices for
him.&nbsp; Though I&rsquo;ve heard of those <i>you</i> make I
don&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moreen stared a moment; then with emotion she grasped her
inmate&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Will</i> you make
it&mdash;the sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He burst out laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll do what I can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay a little
longer.&nbsp; Your calculation&rsquo;s just&mdash;I <i>do</i>
hate intensely to give him up; I&rsquo;m fond of him and he
thoroughly interests me, in spite of the inconvenience I
suffer.&nbsp; You know my situation perfectly.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t a penny in the world and, occupied as you see me
with Morgan, am unable to earn money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moreen tapped her undressed arm with her folded
bank-note.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you write articles?&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you translate as <i>I</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about translating; it&rsquo;s
wretchedly paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to earn what I can,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Moreen with prodigious virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to tell me who you do it for.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pemberton paused a moment, and she said nothing; so he added:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to turn off some little sketches, but the
magazines won&rsquo;t have them&mdash;they&rsquo;re declined with
thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see then you&rsquo;re not such a
ph&oelig;nix,&rdquo; his visitor pointedly smiled&mdash;&ldquo;to
pretend to abilities you&rsquo;re sacrificing for our
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to do things properly,&rdquo; he
ruefully went on.&nbsp; Then as it came over him that he was
almost abjectly good-natured to give these explanations he added:
&ldquo;If I stay on longer it must be on one condition&mdash;that
Morgan shall know distinctly on what footing I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moreen demurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t want
to show off to a child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To show <i>you</i> off, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she cast about, but this time it was to produce a still
finer flower.&nbsp; &ldquo;And <i>you</i> talk of
blackmail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can easily prevent it,&rdquo; said Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> talk of practising on fears,&rdquo; she
bravely pushed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no doubt I&rsquo;m a great
scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His patroness met his eyes&mdash;it was clear she was in
straits.&nbsp; Then she thrust out her money at him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Moreen desired me to give you this on
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to Mr. Moreen, but we
<i>have</i> no account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That leaves me more free,&rdquo; said Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To poison my darling&rsquo;s mind?&rdquo; groaned Mrs.
Moreen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh your darling&rsquo;s mind&mdash;!&rdquo; the young
man laughed.</p>
<p>She fixed him a moment, and he thought she was going to break
out tormentedly, pleadingly: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, tell me
what <i>is</i> in it!&rdquo;&nbsp; But she checked this
impulse&mdash;another was stronger.&nbsp; She pocketed the
money&mdash;the crudity of the alternative was comical&mdash;and
swept out of the room with the desperate concession: &ldquo;You
may tell him any horror you like!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>A couple of days after this, during which he had failed to
profit by so free a permission, he had been for a quarter of an
hour walking with his charge in silence when the boy became
sociable again with the remark: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how I
know it; I know it through Z&eacute;nobie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Z&eacute;nobie?&nbsp; Who in the world is
<i>she</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nurse I used to have&mdash;ever so many years
ago.&nbsp; A charming woman.&nbsp; I liked her awfully, and she
liked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes.&nbsp; What is
it you know through her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why what their idea is.&nbsp; She went away because
they didn&rsquo;t fork out.&nbsp; She did like me awfully, and
she stayed two years.&nbsp; She told me all about it&mdash;that
at last she could never get her wages.&nbsp; As soon as they saw
how much she liked me they stopped giving her anything.&nbsp;
They thought she&rsquo;d stay for nothing&mdash;just
<i>because</i>, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Morgan had
a queer little conscious lucid look.&nbsp; &ldquo;She did stay
ever so long&mdash;as long an she could.&nbsp; She was only a
poor girl.&nbsp; She used to send money to her mother.&nbsp; At
last she couldn&rsquo;t afford it any longer, and went away in a
fearful rage one night&mdash;I mean of course in a rage against
<i>them</i>.&nbsp; She cried over me tremendously, she hugged me
nearly to death.&nbsp; She told me all about it,&rdquo; the boy
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me it was their idea.&nbsp; So I
guessed, ever so long ago, that they have had the same idea with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Z&eacute;nobie was very sharp,&rdquo; said
Pemberton.&nbsp; &ldquo;And she made you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that wasn&rsquo;t Z&eacute;nobie; that was
nature.&nbsp; And experience!&rdquo; Morgan laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Z&eacute;nobie was a part of your
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I was a part of hers, poor dear!&rdquo; the
boy wisely sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m part of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very important part.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see how
you know that I&rsquo;ve been treated like
Z&eacute;nobie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for the biggest dunce you&rsquo;ve
known?&rdquo; Morgan asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been
conscious of what we&rsquo;ve been through together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve been through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our privations&mdash;our dark days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh our days have been bright enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan went on in silence for a moment.&nbsp; Then he said:
&ldquo;My dear chap, you&rsquo;re a hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re another!&rdquo; Pemberton
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not, but I ain&rsquo;t a baby.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t stand it any longer.&nbsp; You must get some
occupation that pays.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ashamed, I&rsquo;m
ashamed!&rdquo; quavered the boy with a ring of passion, like
some high silver note from a small cathedral cloister, that
deeply touched his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to go off and live somewhere together,&rdquo;
the young man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go like a shot if you&rsquo;ll take
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d get some work that would keep us both
afloat,&rdquo; Pemberton continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I work?&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t such a beastly little muff as that comes
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulty is that your parents wouldn&rsquo;t hear
of it.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d never part with you; they worship the
ground you tread on.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see the proof of
it?&rdquo; Pemberton developed.&nbsp; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
dislike me; they wish me no harm; they&rsquo;re very amiable
people; but they&rsquo;re perfectly ready to expose me to any
awkwardness in life for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence in which Morgan received his fond sophistry struck
Pemberton somehow as expressive.&nbsp; After a moment the child
repeated: &ldquo;You are a hero!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added:
&ldquo;They leave me with you altogether.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve all
the responsibility.&nbsp; They put me off on you from morning
till night.&nbsp; Why then should they object to my taking up
with you completely?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not particularly keen about my being
helped, and they delight in thinking of you as
<i>theirs</i>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re tremendously proud of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not proud of <i>them</i>.&nbsp; But you know
that,&rdquo; Morgan returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for the little matter we speak of they&rsquo;re
charming people,&rdquo; said Pemberton, not taking up the point
made for his intelligence, but wondering greatly at the
boy&rsquo;s own, and especially at this fresh reminder of
something he had been conscious of from the first&mdash;the
strangest thing in his friend&rsquo;s large little composition, a
temper, a sensibility, even a private ideal, which made him as
privately disown the stuff his people were made of.&nbsp; Morgan
had in secret a small loftiness which made him acute about
betrayed meanness; as well as a critical sense for the manners
immediately surrounding him that was quite without precedent in a
juvenile nature, especially when one noted that it had not made
this nature &ldquo;old-fashioned,&rdquo; as the word is of
children&mdash;quaint or wizened or offensive.&nbsp; It was as if
he had been a little gentleman and had paid the penalty by
discovering that he was the only such person in his family.&nbsp;
This comparison didn&rsquo;t make him vain, but it could make him
melancholy and a trifle austere.&nbsp; While Pemberton guessed at
these dim young things, shadows of shadows, he was partly drawn
on and partly checked, as for a scruple, by the charm of
attempting to sound the little cool shallows that were so quickly
growing deeper.&nbsp; When he tried to figure to himself the
morning twilight of childhood, so as to deal with it safely, he
saw it was never fixed, never arrested, that ignorance, at the
instant he touched it, was already flushing faintly into
knowledge, that there was nothing that at a given moment you
could say an intelligent child didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It seemed
to him that he himself knew too much to imagine Morgan&rsquo;s
simplicity and too little to disembroil his tangle.</p>
<p>The boy paid no heed to his last remark; he only went on:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have spoken to them about their idea, as I call
it, long ago, if I hadn&rsquo;t been sure what they&rsquo;d
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what they said about what poor Z&eacute;nobie told
me&mdash;that it was a horrid dreadful story, that they had paid
her every penny they owed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps they had,&rdquo; said Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ve paid you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pretend they have, and n&rsquo;en parlons
plus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They accused her of lying and
cheating&rdquo;&mdash;Morgan stuck to historic truth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to speak to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lest they should accuse me, too?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this
Morgan made no answer, and his companion, looking down at
him&mdash;the boy turned away his eyes, which had
filled&mdash;saw what he couldn&rsquo;t have trusted himself to
utter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t worry
them,&rdquo; Pemberton pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except for that,
they <i>are</i> charming people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for <i>their</i> lying and <i>their</i>
cheating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;I say!&rdquo; cried Pemberton, imitating a
little tone of the lad&rsquo;s which was itself an imitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be frank, at the last; we <i>must</i> come to
an understanding,&rdquo; said Morgan with the importance of the
small boy who lets himself think he is arranging great
affairs&mdash;almost playing at shipwreck or at Indians.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know all about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say your father has his reasons,&rdquo;
Pemberton replied, but too vaguely, as he was aware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For lying and cheating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For saving and managing and turning his means to the
best account.&nbsp; He has plenty to do with his money.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re an expensive family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m very expensive,&rdquo; Morgan concurred
in a manner that made his preceptor burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s saving for <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
Pemberton.&nbsp; &ldquo;They think of you in everything they
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might, while he&rsquo;s about it, save a
little&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy paused, and his friend waited
to hear what.&nbsp; Then Morgan brought out oddly: &ldquo;A
little reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there&rsquo;s plenty of that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of it for the people they know, no doubt.&nbsp;
The people they know are awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the princes?&nbsp; We mustn&rsquo;t abuse
the princes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t married
Paula&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t married Amy.&nbsp; They only clean
out Ulick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> know everything!&rdquo; Pemberton
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, after all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what they live on, or how they live, or <i>why</i> they
live!&nbsp; What have they got and how did they get it?&nbsp; Are
they rich, are they poor, or have they a modeste aisance?&nbsp;
Why are they always chiveying me about&mdash;living one year like
ambassadors and the next like paupers?&nbsp; Who are they, any
way, and what are they?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve thought of all
that&mdash;I&rsquo;ve thought of a lot of things.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re so beastly worldly.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I hate
most&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;ve <i>seen</i> it!&nbsp; All they care
about is to make an appearance and to pass for something or
other.&nbsp; What the dickens do they want to pass for?&nbsp;
What <i>do</i> they, Mr. Pemberton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pause for a reply,&rdquo; said Pemberton, treating
the question as a joke, yet wondering too and greatly struck with
his mate&rsquo;s intense if imperfect vision.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what good does it do?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t I seen
the way people treat them&mdash;the &lsquo;nice&rsquo; people,
the ones they want to know?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll take anything
from them&mdash;they&rsquo;ll lie down and be trampled on.&nbsp;
The nice ones hate that&mdash;they just sicken them.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re the only really nice person we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t lie down for
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you shan&rsquo;t lie down for them.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got to go&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got
to do,&rdquo; said Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will become of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m growing up.&nbsp; I shall get off before
long.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better let me finish you,&rdquo; Pemberton
urged, lending himself to the child&rsquo;s strange
superiority.</p>
<p>Morgan stopped in their walk, looking up at him.&nbsp; He had
to look up much less than a couple of years before&mdash;he had
grown, in his loose leanness, so long and high.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Finish me?&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are such a lot of jolly things we can do together
yet.&nbsp; I want to turn you out&mdash;I want you to do me
credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan continued to look at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;To give you
credit&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you&rsquo;re too clever to
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m afraid you
think.&nbsp; No, no; it isn&rsquo;t fair&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
endure it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll separate next week.&nbsp; The sooner
it&rsquo;s over the sooner to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hear of anything&mdash;any other chance&mdash;I
promise to go,&rdquo; Pemberton said.</p>
<p>Morgan consented to consider this.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;ll be honest,&rdquo; he demanded; &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t pretend you haven&rsquo;t heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much more likely to pretend I
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can you hear of, this way, stuck in a hole
with us?&nbsp; You ought to be on the spot, to go to
England&mdash;you ought to go to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you were <i>my</i> tutor!&rdquo; said
Pemberton.</p>
<p>Morgan walked on and after a little had begun again:
&ldquo;Well, now that you know I know and that we look at the
facts and keep nothing back&mdash;it&rsquo;s much more
comfortable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, it&rsquo;s so amusing, so interesting,
that it will surely be quite impossible for me to forego such
hours as these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made Morgan stop once more.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <i>do</i>
keep something back.&nbsp; Oh you&rsquo;re not
straight&mdash;<i>I</i> am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I not straight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;ve got your idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that I probably shan&rsquo;t make old&mdash;make
older&mdash;bones, and that you can stick it out till I&rsquo;m
removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> too clever to live!&rdquo; Pemberton
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call it a mean idea,&rdquo; Morgan pursued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I shall punish you by the way I hang on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out or I&rsquo;ll poison you!&rdquo; Pemberton
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stronger and better every year.&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t you noticed that there hasn&rsquo;t been a doctor
near me since you came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> your doctor,&rdquo; said the young
man, taking his arm and drawing him tenderly on again.</p>
<p>Morgan proceeded and after a few steps gave a sigh of mingled
weariness and relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah now that we look at the
facts it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>They looked at the facts a good deal after this and one of the
first consequences of their doing so was that Pemberton stuck it
out, in his friend&rsquo;s parlance, for the purpose.&nbsp;
Morgan made the facts so vivid and so droll, and at the same time
so bald and so ugly, that there was fascination in talking them
over with him, just as there would have been heartlessness in
leaving him alone with them.&nbsp; Now that the pair had such
perceptions in common it was useless for them to pretend they
didn&rsquo;t judge such people; but the very judgement and the
exchange of perceptions created another tie.&nbsp; Morgan had
never been so interesting as now that he himself was made plainer
by the sidelight of these confidences.&nbsp; What came out in it
most was the small fine passion of his pride.&nbsp; He had plenty
of that, Pemberton felt&mdash;so much that one might perhaps
wisely wish for it some early bruises.&nbsp; He would have liked
his people to have a spirit and had waked up to the sense of
their perpetually eating humble-pie.&nbsp; His mother would
consume any amount, and his father would consume even more than
his mother.&nbsp; He had a theory that Ulick had wriggled out of
an &ldquo;affair&rdquo; at Nice: there had once been a flurry at
home, a regular panic, after which they all went to bed and took
medicine, not to be accounted for on any other supposition.&nbsp;
Morgan had a romantic imagination, led by poetry and history, and
he would have liked those who &ldquo;bore his
name&rdquo;&mdash;as he used to say to Pemberton with the humour
that made his queer delicacies manly&mdash;to carry themselves
with an air.&nbsp; But their one idea was to get in with people
who didn&rsquo;t want them and to take snubs as it they were
honourable scars.&nbsp; Why people didn&rsquo;t want them more he
didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;that was people&rsquo;s own affair; after
all they weren&rsquo;t superficially repulsive, they were a
hundred times cleverer than most of the dreary grandees, the
&ldquo;poor swells&rdquo; they rushed about Europe to catch up
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all they <i>are</i> amusing&mdash;they
are!&rdquo; he used to pronounce with the wisdom of the
ages.&nbsp; To which Pemberton always replied:
&ldquo;Amusing&mdash;the great Moreen troupe?&nbsp; Why
they&rsquo;re altogether delightful; and if it weren&rsquo;t for
the hitch that you and I (feeble performers!) make in the
ensemble they&rsquo;d carry everything before them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the boy couldn&rsquo;t get over was the fact that this
particular blight seemed, in a tradition of self-respect, so
undeserved and so arbitrary.&nbsp; No doubt people had a right to
take the line they liked; but why should his people have liked
the line of pushing and toadying and lying and cheating?&nbsp;
What had their forefathers&mdash;all decent folk, so far as he
knew&mdash;done to them, or what had he done to them?&nbsp; Who
had poisoned their blood with the fifth-rate social ideal, the
fixed idea of making smart acquaintances and getting into the
monde chic, especially when it was foredoomed to failure and
exposure?&nbsp; They showed so what they were after; that was
what made the people they wanted not want <i>them</i>.&nbsp; And
never a wince for dignity, never a throb of shame at looking each
other in the face, never any independence or resentment or
disgust.&nbsp; If his father or his brother would only knock some
one down once or twice a year!&nbsp; Clever as they were they
never guessed the impression they made.&nbsp; They were
good-natured, yes&mdash;as good-natured as Jews at the doors of
clothing-shops!&nbsp; But was that the model one wanted
one&rsquo;s family to follow?&nbsp; Morgan had dim memories of an
old grandfather, the maternal, in New York, whom he had been
taken across the ocean at the age of five to see: a gentleman
with a high neck-cloth and a good deal of pronunciation, who wore
a dress-coat in the morning, which made one wonder what he wore
in the evening, and had, or was supposed to have
&ldquo;property&rdquo; and something to do with the Bible
Society.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t have been but that he was a good
type.&nbsp; Pemberton himself remembered Mrs. Clancy, a widowed
sister of Mr. Moreen&rsquo;s, who was as irritating as a moral
tale and had paid a fortnight&rsquo;s visit to the family at Nice
shortly after he came to live with them.&nbsp; She was
&ldquo;pure and refined,&rdquo; as Amy said over the banjo, and
had the air of not knowing what they meant when they talked, and
of keeping something rather important back.&nbsp; Pemberton
judged that what she kept back was an approval of many of their
ways; therefore it was to be supposed that she too was of a good
type, and that Mr. and Mrs. Moreen and Ulick and Paula and Amy
might easily have been of a better one if they would.</p>
<p>But that they wouldn&rsquo;t was more and more perceptible
from day to day.&nbsp; They continued to &ldquo;chivey,&rdquo; as
Morgan called it, and in due time became aware of a variety of
reasons for proceeding to Venice.&nbsp; They mentioned a great
many of them&mdash;they were always strikingly frank and had the
brightest friendly chatter, at the late foreign breakfast in
especial, before the ladies had made up their faces, when they
leaned their arms on the table, had something to follow the
demitasse, and, in the heat of familiar discussion as to what
they &ldquo;really ought&rdquo; to do, fell inevitably into the
languages in which they could tutoyer.&nbsp; Even Pemberton liked
them then; he could endure even Ulick when he heard him give his
little flat voice for the &ldquo;sweet sea-city.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That was what made him have a sneaking kindness for
them&mdash;that they were so out of the workaday world and kept
him so out of it.&nbsp; The summer had waned when, with cries of
ecstasy, they all passed out on the balcony that overhung the
Grand Canal.&nbsp; The sunsets then were splendid and the
Dorringtons had arrived.&nbsp; The Dorringtons were the only
reason they hadn&rsquo;t talked of at breakfast; but the reasons
they didn&rsquo;t talk of at breakfast always came out in the
end.&nbsp; The Dorringtons on the other hand came out very
little; or else when they did they stayed&mdash;as was
natural&mdash;for hours, during which periods Mrs. Moreen and the
girls sometimes called at their hotel (to see if they had
returned) as many as three times running.&nbsp; The gondola was
for the ladies, as in Venice too there were &ldquo;days,&rdquo;
which Mrs. Moreen knew in their order an hour after she
arrived.&nbsp; She immediately took one herself, to which the
Dorringtons never came, though on a certain occasion when
Pemberton and his pupil were together at St.
Mark&rsquo;s&mdash;where, taking the best walks they had ever had
and haunting a hundred churches, they spent a great deal of
time&mdash;they saw the old lord turn up with Mr. Moreen and
Ulick, who showed him the dim basilica as if it belonged to
them.&nbsp; Pemberton noted how much less, among its curiosities,
Lord Dorrington carried himself as a man of the world; wondering
too whether, for such services, his companions took a fee from
him.&nbsp; The autumn at any rate waned, the Dorringtons
departed, and Lord Verschoyle, the eldest son, had proposed
neither for Amy nor for Paula.</p>
<p>One sad November day, while the wind roared round the old
palace and the rain lashed the lagoon, Pemberton, for exercise
and even somewhat for warmth&mdash;the Moreens were horribly
frugal about fires; it was a cause of suffering to their
inmate&mdash;walked up and down the big bare sala with his
pupil.&nbsp; The scagliola floor was cold, the high battered
casements shook in the storm, and the stately decay of the place
was unrelieved by a particle of furniture.&nbsp;
Pemberton&rsquo;s spirits were low, and it came over him that the
fortune of the Moreens was now even lower.&nbsp; A blast of
desolation, a portent of disgrace and disaster, seemed to draw
through the comfortless hall.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen and Ulick were in
the Piazza, looking out for something, strolling drearily, in
mackintoshes, under the arcades; but still, in spite of
mackintoshes, unmistakeable men of the world.&nbsp; Paula and Amy
were in bed&mdash;it might have been thought they were staying
there to keep warm.&nbsp; Pemberton looked askance at the boy at
his side, to see to what extent he was conscious of these dark
omens.&nbsp; But Morgan, luckily for him, was now mainly
conscious of growing taller and stronger and indeed of being in
his fifteenth year.&nbsp; This fact was intensely interesting to
him and the basis of a private theory&mdash;which, however, he
had imparted to his tutor&mdash;that in a little while he should
stand on his own feet.&nbsp; He considered that the situation
would change&mdash;that in short he should be
&ldquo;finished,&rdquo; grown up, producible in the world of
affairs and ready to prove himself of sterling ability.&nbsp;
Sharply as he was capable at times of analysing, as he called it,
his life, there were happy hours when he remained, as he also
called it&mdash;and as the name, really, of their right
ideal&mdash;&ldquo;jolly&rdquo; superficial; the proof of which
was his fundamental assumption that he should presently go to
Oxford, to Pemberton&rsquo;s college, and, aided and abetted by
Pemberton, do the most wonderful things.&nbsp; It depressed the
young man to see how little in such a project he took account of
ways and means: in other connexions he mostly kept to the
measure.&nbsp; Pemberton tried to imagine the Moreens at Oxford
and fortunately failed; yet unless they were to adopt it as a
residence there would be no modus vivendi for Morgan.&nbsp; How
could he live without an allowance, and where was the allowance
to come from?&nbsp; He, Pemberton, might live on Morgan; but how
could Morgan live on <i>him</i>?&nbsp; What was to become of him
anyhow?&nbsp; Somehow the fact that he was a big boy now, with
better prospects of health, made the question of his future more
difficult.&nbsp; So long as he was markedly frail the great
consideration he inspired seemed enough of an answer to it.&nbsp;
But at the bottom of Pemberton&rsquo;s heart was the recognition
of his probably being strong enough to live and not yet strong
enough to struggle or to thrive.&nbsp; Morgan himself at any rate
was in the first flush of the rosiest consciousness of
adolescence, so that the beating of the tempest seemed to him
after all but the voice of life and the challenge of fate.&nbsp;
He had on his shabby little overcoat, with the collar up, but was
enjoying his walk.</p>
<p>It was interrupted at last by the appearance of his mother at
the end of the sala.&nbsp; She beckoned him to come to her, and
while Pemberton saw him, complaisant, pass down the long vista
and over the damp false marble, he wondered what was in the
air.&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen said a word to the boy and made him go
into the room she had quitted.&nbsp; Then, having closed the door
after him, she directed her steps swiftly to Pemberton.&nbsp;
There was something in the air, but his wildest flight of fancy
wouldn&rsquo;t have suggested what it proved to be.&nbsp; She
signified that she had made a pretext to get Morgan out of the
way, and then she enquired&mdash;without hesitation&mdash;if the
young man could favour her with the loan of three louis.&nbsp;
While, before bursting into a laugh, he stared at her with
surprise, she declared that she was awfully pressed for the
money; she was desperate for it&mdash;it would save her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lady, c&rsquo;est trop fort!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pemberton laughed in the manner and with the borrowed grace of
idiom that marked the best colloquial, the best anecdotic,
moments of his friends themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where in the
world do you suppose I should get three louis, du train dont vous
allez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you worked&mdash;wrote things.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t they pay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you such a fool as to work for nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought surely to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moreen stared, then she coloured a little.&nbsp;
Pemberton saw she had quite forgotten the terms&mdash;if
&ldquo;terms&rdquo; they could be called&mdash;that he had ended
by accepting from herself; they had burdened her memory as little
as her conscience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, I see what you
mean&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been very nice about that; but why drag
it in so often?&rdquo;&nbsp; She had been perfectly urbane with
him ever since the rough scene of explanation in his room the
morning he made her accept <i>his</i>
&ldquo;terms&rdquo;&mdash;the necessity of his making his case
known to Morgan.&nbsp; She had felt no resentment after seeing
there was no danger Morgan would take the matter up with
her.&nbsp; Indeed, attributing this immunity to the good taste of
his influence with the boy, she had once said to Pemberton
&ldquo;My dear fellow, it&rsquo;s an immense comfort you&rsquo;re
a gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; She repeated this in substance
now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re a
gentleman&mdash;that&rsquo;s a bother the less!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pemberton reminded her that he had not &ldquo;dragged in&rdquo;
anything that wasn&rsquo;t already in as much as his foot was in
his shoe; and she also repeated her prayer that, somewhere and
somehow, he would find her sixty francs.&nbsp; He took the
liberty of hinting that if he could find them it wouldn&rsquo;t
be to lend them to <i>her</i>&mdash;as to which he consciously
did himself injustice, knowing that if he had them he would
certainly put them at her disposal.&nbsp; He accused himself, at
bottom and not unveraciously, of a fantastic, a demoralised
sympathy with her.&nbsp; If misery made strange bedfellows it
also made strange sympathies.&nbsp; It was moreover a part of the
abasement of living with such people that one had to make vulgar
retorts, quite out of one&rsquo;s own tradition of good
manners.&nbsp; &ldquo;Morgan, Morgan, to what pass have I come
for you?&rdquo; he groaned while Mrs. Moreen floated voluminously
down the sala again to liberate the boy, wailing as she went that
everything was too odious.</p>
<p>Before their young friend was liberated there came a thump at
the door communicating with the staircase, followed by the
apparition of a dripping youth who poked in his head.&nbsp;
Pemberton recognised him as the bearer of a telegram and
recognised the telegram as addressed to himself.&nbsp; Morgan
came back as, after glancing at the signature&mdash;that of a
relative in London&mdash;he was reading the words: &ldquo;Found a
jolly job for you, engagement to coach opulent youth on own
terms.&nbsp; Come at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer happily was
paid and the messenger waited.&nbsp; Morgan, who had drawn near,
waited too and looked hard at Pemberton; and Pemberton, after a
moment, having met his look, handed him the telegram.&nbsp; It
was really by wise looks&mdash;they knew each other so well
now&mdash;that, while the telegraph-boy, in his waterproof cape,
made a great puddle on the floor, the thing was settled between
them.&nbsp; Pemberton wrote the answer with a pencil against the
frescoed wall, and the messenger departed.&nbsp; When he had gone
the young man explained himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a tremendous charge; I&rsquo;ll earn a
lot of money in a short time, and we&rsquo;ll live on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope the opulent youth will be a dismal
dunce&mdash;he probably will&mdash;&rdquo; Morgan
parenthesised&mdash;&ldquo;and keep you a long time a-hammering
of it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the longer he keeps me the more we shall have
for our old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose <i>they</i> don&rsquo;t pay you!&rdquo;
Morgan awfully suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there are not two such&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Pemberton pulled up; he had been on the point of using too
invidious a term.&nbsp; Instead of this he said &ldquo;Two such
fatalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan flushed&mdash;the tears came to his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dites toujours two such rascally crews!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
in a different tone he added: &ldquo;Happy opulent
youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he&rsquo;s a dismal dunce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh they&rsquo;re happier then.&nbsp; But you
can&rsquo;t have everything, can you?&rdquo; the boy smiled.</p>
<p>Pemberton held him fast, hands on his shoulders&mdash;he had
never loved him so.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will become of you, what
will you do?&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought of Mrs. Moreen, desperate
for sixty francs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall become an homme fait.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then as
if he recognised all the bearings of Pemberton&rsquo;s allusion:
&ldquo;I shall get on with them better when you&rsquo;re not
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;it sounds as if I set you
against them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do&mdash;the sight of you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all
right; you know what I mean.&nbsp; I shall be beautiful.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take their affairs in hand; I&rsquo;ll marry my
sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry yourself!&rdquo; joked Pemberton; as
high, rather tense pleasantry would evidently be the right, or
the safest, tone for their separation.</p>
<p>It was, however, not purely in this strain that Morgan
suddenly asked: &ldquo;But I say&mdash;how will you get to your
jolly job?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to telegraph to the opulent
youth for money to come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pemberton bethought himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t
like that, will they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh look out for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Pemberton brought out his remedy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go to the American Consul; I&rsquo;ll borrow some money of
him&mdash;just for the few days, on the strength of the
telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan was hilarious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show him the
telegram&mdash;then collar the money and stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pemberton entered into the joke sufficiently to reply that for
Morgan he was really capable of that; but the boy, growing more
serious, and to prove he hadn&rsquo;t meant what he said, not
only hurried him off to the Consulate&mdash;since he was to start
that evening, as he had wired to his friend&mdash;but made sure
of their affair by going with him.&nbsp; They splashed through
the tortuous perforations and over the humpbacked bridges, and
they passed through the Piazza, where they saw Mr. Moreen and
Ulick go into a jeweller&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; The Consul proved
accommodating&mdash;Pemberton said it wasn&rsquo;t the letter,
but Morgan&rsquo;s grand air&mdash;and on their way back they
went into Saint Mark&rsquo;s for a hushed ten minutes.&nbsp;
Later they took up and kept up the fun of it to the very end; and
it seemed to Pemberton a part of that fun that Mrs. Moreen, who
was very angry when he had announced her his intention, should
charge him, grotesquely and vulgarly and in reference to the loan
she had vainly endeavoured to effect, with bolting lest they
should &ldquo;get something out&rdquo; of him.&nbsp; On the other
hand he had to do Mr. Moreen and Ulick the justice to recognise
that when on coming in they heard the cruel news they took it
like perfect men of the world.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>When he got at work with the opulent youth, who was to be
taken in hand for Balliol, he found himself unable to say if this
aspirant had really such poor parts or if the appearance were
only begotten of his own long association with an intensely
living little mind.&nbsp; From Morgan he heard half a dozen
times: the boy wrote charming young letters, a patchwork of
tongues, with indulgent postscripts in the family Volapuk and, in
little squares and rounds and crannies of the text, the drollest
illustrations&mdash;letters that he was divided between the
impulse to show his present charge as a vain, a wasted incentive,
and the sense of something in them that publicity would
profane.&nbsp; The opulent youth went up in due course and failed
to pass; but it seemed to add to the presumption that brilliancy
was not expected of him all at once that his parents, condoning
the lapse, which they good-naturedly treated as little as
possible as if it were Pemberton&rsquo;s, should have sounded the
rally again, begged the young coach to renew the siege.</p>
<p>The young coach was now in a position to lend Mrs. Moreen
three louis, and he sent her a post-office order even for a
larger amount.&nbsp; In return for this favour he received a
frantic scribbled line from her: &ldquo;Implore you to come back
instantly&mdash;Morgan dreadfully ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were on
there rebound, once more in Paris&mdash;often as Pemberton had
seen them depressed he had never seen them crushed&mdash;and
communication was therefore rapid.&nbsp; He wrote to the boy to
ascertain the state of his health, but awaited the answer in
vain.&nbsp; He accordingly, after three days, took an abrupt
leave of the opulent youth and, crossing the Channel, alighted at
the small hotel, in the quarter of the Champs Elys&eacute;es, of
which Mrs. Moreen had given him the address.&nbsp; A deep if dumb
dissatisfaction with this lady and her companions bore him
company: they couldn&rsquo;t be vulgarly honest, but they could
live at hotels, in velvety entresols, amid a smell of burnt
pastilles, surrounded by the most expensive city in Europe.&nbsp;
When he had left them in Venice it was with an irrepressible
suspicion that something was going to happen; but the only thing
that could have taken place was again their masterly
retreat.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is he? where is he?&rdquo; he asked of
Mrs. Moreen; but before she could speak these questions were
answered by the pressure round hid neck of a pair of arms, in
shrunken sleeves, which still were perfectly capable of an
effusive young foreign squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadfully ill&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; the
young man cried.&nbsp; And then to Morgan: &ldquo;Why on earth
didn&rsquo;t you relieve me?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you answer my
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Moreen declared that when she wrote he was very bad, and
Pemberton learned at the same time from the boy that he had
answered every letter he had received.&nbsp; This led to the
clear inference that Pemberton&rsquo;s note had been kept from
him so that the game practised should not be interfered
with.&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen was prepared to see the fact exposed, as
Pemberton saw the moment he faced her that she was prepared for a
good many other things.&nbsp; She was prepared above all to
maintain that she had acted from a sense of duty, that she was
enchanted she had got him over, whatever they might say, and that
it was useless of him to pretend he didn&rsquo;t know in all his
bones that his place at such a time was with Morgan.&nbsp; He had
taken the boy away from them and now had no right to abandon
him.&nbsp; He had created for himself the gravest
responsibilities and must at least abide by what he had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken him away from you?&rdquo; Pemberton exclaimed
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it&mdash;do it for pity&rsquo;s sake; that&rsquo;s
just what I want.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stand <i>this</i>&mdash;and
such scenes.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re awful frauds&mdash;poor
dears!&rdquo;&nbsp; These words broke from Morgan, who had
intermitted his embrace, in a key which made Pemberton turn
quickly to him and see that he had suddenly seated himself, was
breathing in great pain, and was very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i> do you say he&rsquo;s not in a state, my
precious pet?&rdquo; shouted his mother, dropping on her knees
before him with clasped hands, but touching him no more than if
he had been a gilded idol.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will
pass&mdash;it&rsquo;s only for an instant; but don&rsquo;t say
such dreadful things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right&mdash;all right,&rdquo; Morgan
panted to Pemberton, whom he sat looking up at with a strange
smile, his hands resting on either side of the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do you pretend I&rsquo;ve been dishonest, that
I&rsquo;ve deceived?&rdquo; Mrs. Moreen flashed at Pemberton as
she got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t <i>he</i> says it, it&rsquo;s I!&rdquo;
the boy returned, apparently easier, but sinking back against the
wall; while his restored friend, who had sat down beside him,
took his hand and bent over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling child, one does what one can; there are so many
things to consider,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Moreen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his <i>place</i>&mdash;his only place.&nbsp;
You see <i>you</i> think it is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me away&mdash;take me away,&rdquo; Morgan went on,
smiling to Pemberton with his white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I take you, and how&mdash;oh <i>how</i>, my
boy?&rdquo; the young man stammered, thinking of the rude way in
which his friends in London held that, for his convenience, with
no assurance of prompt return, he had thrown them over; of the
just resentment with which they would already have called in a
successor, and of the scant help to finding fresh employment that
resided for him in the grossness of his having failed to pass his
pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ll settle that.&nbsp; You used to talk
about it,&rdquo; said Morgan.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we can only go all
the rest&rsquo;s a detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about it as much as you like, but don&rsquo;t
think you can attempt it.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen would never
consent&mdash;it would be so <i>very</i> hand-to-mouth,&rdquo;
Pemberton&rsquo;s hostess beautifully explained to him.&nbsp;
Then to Morgan she made it clearer: &ldquo;It would destroy our
peace, it would break our hearts.&nbsp; Now that he&rsquo;s back
it will be all the same again.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have your life,
your work and your freedom, and we&rsquo;ll all be happy as we
used to be.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll bloom and grow perfectly well, and
we won&rsquo;t have any more silly experiments, will we?&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re too absurd.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Mr. Pemberton&rsquo;s
place&mdash;every one in his place.&nbsp; You in yours, your papa
in his, me in mine&mdash;n&rsquo;est-ce pas, ch&eacute;ri?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll all forget how foolish we&rsquo;ve been and have
lovely times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued to talk and to surge vaguely about the little
draped stuffy salon while Pemberton sat with the boy, whose
colour gradually came back; and she mixed up her reasons, hinting
that there were going to be changes, that the other children
might scatter (who knew?&mdash;Paula had her ideas) and that then
it might be fancied how much the poor old parent-birds would want
the little nestling.&nbsp; Morgan looked at Pemberton, who
wouldn&rsquo;t let him move; and Pemberton knew exactly how he
felt at hearing himself called a little nestling.&nbsp; He
admitted that he had had one or two bad days, but he protested
afresh against the wrong of his mother&rsquo;s having made them
the ground of an appeal to poor Pemberton.&nbsp; Poor Pemberton
could laugh now, apart from the comicality of Mrs. Moreen&rsquo;s
mustering so much philosophy for her defence&mdash;she seemed to
shake it out of her agitated petticoats, which knocked over the
light gilt chairs&mdash;so little did their young companion,
<i>marked</i>, unmistakeably marked at the best, strike him as
qualified to repudiate any advantage.</p>
<p>He himself was in for it at any rate.&nbsp; He should have
Morgan on his hands again indefinitely; though indeed he saw the
lad had a private theory to produce which would be intended to
smooth this down.&nbsp; He was obliged to him for it in advance;
but the suggested amendment didn&rsquo;t keep his heart rather
from sinking, any more than it prevented him from accepting the
prospect on the spot, with some confidence moreover that he
should do so even better if he could have a little supper.&nbsp;
Mrs. Moreen threw out more hints about the changes that were to
be looked for, but she was such a mixture of smiles and
shudders&mdash;she confessed she was very nervous&mdash;that he
couldn&rsquo;t tell if she were in high feather or only in
hysterics.&nbsp; If the family was really at last going to pieces
why shouldn&rsquo;t she recognise the necessity of pitching
Morgan into some sort of lifeboat?&nbsp; This presumption was
fostered by the fact that they were established in luxurious
quarters in the capital of pleasure; that was exactly where they
naturally <i>would</i> be established in view of going to
pieces.&nbsp; Moreover didn&rsquo;t she mention that Mr. Moreen
and the others were enjoying themselves at the opera with Mr.
Granger, and wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> also precisely where one
would look for them on the eve of a smash?&nbsp; Pemberton
gathered that Mr. Granger was a rich vacant American&mdash;a big
bill with a flourishy heading and no items; so that one of
Paula&rsquo;s &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; was probably that this time she
hadn&rsquo;t missed fire&mdash;by which straight shot indeed she
would have shattered the general cohesion.&nbsp; And if the
cohesion was to crumble what would become of poor
Pemberton?&nbsp; He felt quite enough bound up with them to
figure to his alarm as a dislodged block in the edifice.</p>
<p>It was Morgan who eventually asked if no supper had been
ordered for him; sitting with him below, later, at the dim
delayed meal, in the presence of a great deal of corded green
plush, a plate of ornamental biscuit and an aloofness marked on
the part of the waiter.&nbsp; Mrs. Moreen had explained that they
had been obliged to secure a room for the visitor out of the
house; and Morgan&rsquo;s consolation&mdash;he offered it while
Pemberton reflected on the nastiness of lukewarm
sauces&mdash;proved to be, largely, that his circumstance would
facilitate their escape.&nbsp; He talked of their
escape&mdash;recurring to it often afterwards&mdash;as if they
were making up a &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s book&rdquo; together.&nbsp;
But he likewise expressed his sense that there was something in
the air, that the Moreens couldn&rsquo;t keep it up much
longer.&nbsp; In point of fact, as Pemberton was to see, they
kept it up for five or six months.&nbsp; All the while, however,
Morgan&rsquo;s contention was designed to cheer him.&nbsp; Mr.
Moreen and Ulick, whom he had met the day after his return,
accepted that return like perfect men of the world.&nbsp; If
Paula and Amy treated it even with less formality an allowance
was to be made for them, inasmuch as Mr. Granger hadn&rsquo;t
come to the opera after all.&nbsp; He had only placed his box at
their service, with a bouquet for each of the party; there was
even one apiece, embittering the thought of his profusion, for
Mr. Moreen and Ulick.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all like
that,&rdquo; was Morgan&rsquo;s comment; &ldquo;at the very last,
just when we think we&rsquo;ve landed them they&rsquo;re back in
the deep sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s comments in these days were more and more free;
they even included a large recognition of the extraordinary
tenderness with which he had been treated while Pemberton was
away.&nbsp; Oh yes, they couldn&rsquo;t do enough to be nice to
him, to show him they had him on their mind and make up for his
loss.&nbsp; That was just what made the whole thing so sad and
caused him to rejoice after all in Pemberton&rsquo;s
return&mdash;he had to keep thinking of their affection less, had
less sense of obligation.&nbsp; Pemberton laughed out at this
last reason, and Morgan blushed and said: &ldquo;Well, dash it,
you know what I mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pemberton knew perfectly what
he meant; but there were a good many things that&mdash;dash it
too!&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t make any clearer.&nbsp; This episode
of his second sojourn in Paris stretched itself out wearily, with
their resumed readings and wanderings and maunderings, their
potterings on the quays, their hauntings of the museums, their
occasional lingerings in the Palais Royal when the first sharp
weather came on and there was a comfort in warm emanations,
before Chevet&rsquo;s wonderful succulent window.&nbsp; Morgan
wanted to hear all about the opulent youth&mdash;he took an
immense interest in him.&nbsp; Some of the details of his
opulence&mdash;Pemberton could spare him none of
them&mdash;evidently fed the boy&rsquo;s appreciation of all his
friend had given up to come back to him; but in addition to the
greater reciprocity established by that heroism he had always his
little brooding theory, in which there was a frivolous gaiety
too, that their long probation was drawing to a close.&nbsp;
Morgan&rsquo;s conviction that the Moreens couldn&rsquo;t go on
much longer kept pace with the unexpended impetus with which,
from month to month, they did go on.&nbsp; Three weeks after
Pemberton had rejoined them they went on to another hotel, a
dingier one than the first; but Morgan rejoiced that his tutor
had at least still not sacrificed the advantage of a room
outside.&nbsp; He clung to the romantic utility of this when the
day, or rather the night, should arrive for their escape.</p>
<p>For the first time, in this complicated connexion, our friend
felt his collar gall him.&nbsp; It was, as he had said to Mrs.
Moreen in Venice, trop fort&mdash;everything was trop fort.&nbsp;
He could neither really throw off his blighting burden nor find
in it the benefit of a pacified conscience or of a rewarded
affection.&nbsp; He had spent all the money accruing to him in
England, and he saw his youth going and that he was getting
nothing back for it.&nbsp; It was all very well of Morgan to
count it for reparation that he should now settle on him
permanently&mdash;there was an irritating flaw in such a
view.&nbsp; He saw what the boy had in his mind; the conception
that as his friend had had the generosity to come back he must
show his gratitude by giving him his life.&nbsp; But the poor
friend didn&rsquo;t desire the gift&mdash;what could he do with
Morgan&rsquo;s dreadful little life?&nbsp; Of course at the same
time that Pemberton was irritated he remembered the reason, which
was very honourable to Morgan and which dwelt simply in his
making one so forget that he was no more than a patched
urchin.&nbsp; If one dealt with him on a different basis
one&rsquo;s misadventures were one&rsquo;s own fault.&nbsp; So
Pemberton waited in a queer confusion of yearning and alarm for
the catastrophe which was held to hang over the house of Moreen,
of which he certainly at moments felt the symptoms brush his
cheek and as to which he wondered much in what form it would find
its liveliest effect.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would take the form of sudden dispersal&mdash;a
frightened sauve qui peut, a scuttling into selfish
corners.&nbsp; Certainly they were less elastic than of yore;
they were evidently looking for something they didn&rsquo;t
find.&nbsp; The Dorringtons hadn&rsquo;t re-appeared, the princes
had scattered; wasn&rsquo;t that the beginning of the end?&nbsp;
Mrs. Moreen had lost her reckoning of the famous
&ldquo;days&rdquo;; her social calendar was blurred&mdash;it had
turned its face to the wall.&nbsp; Pemberton suspected that the
great, the cruel discomfiture had been the unspeakable behaviour
of Mr. Granger, who seemed not to know what he wanted, or, what
was much worse, what they wanted.&nbsp; He kept sending flowers,
as if to bestrew the path of his retreat, which was never the
path of a return.&nbsp; Flowers were all very well,
but&mdash;Pemberton could complete the proposition.&nbsp; It was
now positively conspicuous that in the long run the Moreens were
a social failure; so that the young man was almost grateful the
run had not been short.&nbsp; Mr. Moreen indeed was still
occasionally able to get away on business and, what was more
surprising, was likewise able to get back.&nbsp; Ulick had no
club but you couldn&rsquo;t have discovered it from his
appearance, which was as much as ever that of a person looking at
life from the window of such an institution; therefore Pemberton
was doubly surprised at an answer he once heard him make his
mother in the desperate tone of a man familiar with the worst
privations.&nbsp; Her question Pemberton had not quite caught; it
appeared to be an appeal for a suggestion as to whom they might
get to take Amy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the Devil take her!&rdquo;
Ulick snapped; so that Pemberton could see that they had not only
lost their amiability but had ceased to believe in
themselves.&nbsp; He could also see that if Mrs. Moreen was
trying to get people to take her children she might be regarded
as closing the hatches for the storm.&nbsp; But Morgan would be
the last she would part with.</p>
<p>One winter afternoon&mdash;it was a Sunday&mdash;he and the
boy walked far together in the Bois de Boulogne.&nbsp; The
evening was so splendid, the cold lemon-coloured sunset so clear,
the stream of carriages and pedestrians so amusing and the
fascination of Paris so great, that they stayed out later than
usual and became aware that they should have to hurry home to
arrive in time for dinner.&nbsp; They hurried accordingly,
arm-in-arm, good-humoured and hungry, agreeing that there was
nothing like Paris after all and that after everything too that
had come and gone they were not yet sated with innocent
pleasures.&nbsp; When they reached the hotel they found that,
though scandalously late, they were in time for all the dinner
they were likely to sit down to.&nbsp; Confusion reigned in the
apartments of the Moreens&mdash;very shabby ones this time, but
the best in the house&mdash;and before the interrupted service of
the table, with objects displaced almost as if there had been a
scuffle and a great wine-stain from an overturned bottle,
Pemberton couldn&rsquo;t blink the fact that there had been a
scene of the last proprietary firmness.&nbsp; The storm had
come&mdash;they were all seeking refuge.&nbsp; The hatches were
down, Paula and Amy were invisible&mdash;they had never tried the
most casual art upon Pemberton, but he felt they had enough of an
eye to him not to wish to meet him as young ladies whose frocks
had been confiscated&mdash;and Ulick appeared to have jumped
overboard.&nbsp; The host and his staff, in a word, had ceased to
&ldquo;go on&rdquo; at the pace of their guests, and the air of
embarrassed detention, thanks to a pile of gaping trunks in the
passage, was strangely commingled with the air of indignant
withdrawal.&nbsp; When Morgan took all this in&mdash;and he took
it in very quickly&mdash;he coloured to the roots of his
hair.&nbsp; He had walked from his infancy among difficulties and
dangers, but he had never seen a public exposure.&nbsp; Pemberton
noticed in a second glance at him that the tears had rushed into
his eyes and that they were tears of a new and untasted
bitterness.&nbsp; He wondered an instant, for the boy&rsquo;s
sake, whether he might successfully pretend not to
understand.&nbsp; Not successfully, he felt, as Mr. and Mrs.
Moreen, dinnerless by their extinguished hearth, rose before him
in their little dishonoured salon, casting about with glassy eyes
for the nearest port in such a storm.&nbsp; They were not
prostrate but were horribly white, and Mrs. Moreen had evidently
been crying.&nbsp; Pemberton quickly learned however that her
grief was not for the loss of her dinner, much as she usually
enjoyed it, but the fruit of a blow that struck even deeper, as
she made all haste to explain.&nbsp; He would see for himself, so
far as that went, how the great change had come, the dreadful
bolt had fallen, and how they would now all have to turn
themselves about.&nbsp; Therefore cruel as it was to them to part
with their darling she must look to him to carry a little further
the influence he had so fortunately acquired with the
boy&mdash;to induce his young charge to follow him into some
modest retreat.&nbsp; They depended on him&mdash;that was the
fact&mdash;to take their delightful child temporarily under his
protection; it would leave Mr. Moreen and herself so much more
free to give the proper attention (too little, alas! had been
given) to the readjustment of their affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We trust you&mdash;we feel we <i>can</i>,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Moreen, slowly rubbing her plump white hands and looking
with compunction hard at Morgan, whose chin, not to take
liberties, her husband stroked with a paternal forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;we feel that we <i>can</i>.&nbsp; We trust
Mr. Pemberton fully, Morgan,&rdquo; Mr. Moreen pursued.</p>
<p>Pemberton wondered again if he might pretend not to
understand; but everything good gave way to the intensity of
Morgan&rsquo;s understanding.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean he may
take me to live with him for ever and ever?&rdquo; cried the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;May take me away, away, anywhere he
likes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever and ever?&nbsp; Comme vous-y-allez!&rdquo; Mr.
Moreen laughed indulgently.&nbsp; &ldquo;For as long as Mr.
Pemberton may be so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve struggled, we&rsquo;ve suffered,&rdquo; his
wife went on; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve made him so your own that
we&rsquo;ve already been through the worst of the
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan had turned away from his father&mdash;he stood looking
at Pemberton with a light in his face.&nbsp; His sense of shame
for their common humiliated state had dropped; the case had
another side&mdash;the thing was to clutch at <i>that</i>.&nbsp;
He had a moment of boyish joy, scarcely mitigated by the
reflexion that with this unexpected consecration of his
hope&mdash;too sudden and too violent; the turn taken was away
from a <i>good</i> boy&rsquo;s book&mdash;the
&ldquo;escape&rdquo; was left on their hands.&nbsp; The boyish
joy was there an instant, and Pemberton was almost scared at the
rush of gratitude and affection that broke through his first
abasement.&nbsp; When he stammered &ldquo;My dear fellow, what do
you say to <i>that</i>?&rdquo; how could one not say something
enthusiastic?&nbsp; But there was more need for courage at
something else that immediately followed and that made the lad
sit down quietly on the nearest chair.&nbsp; He had turned quite
livid and had raised his hand to his left side.&nbsp; They were
all three looking at him, but Mrs. Moreen suddenly bounded
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah his darling little heart!&rdquo; she
broke out; and this time, on her knees before him and without
respect for the idol, she caught him ardently in her arms.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You walked him too far, you hurried him too fast!&rdquo;
she hurled over her shoulder at Pemberton.&nbsp; Her son made no
protest, and the next instant, still holding him, she sprang up
with her face convulsed and with the terrified cry &ldquo;Help,
help! he&rsquo;s going, he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pemberton
saw with equal horror, by Morgan&rsquo;s own stricken face, that
he was beyond their wildest recall.&nbsp; He pulled him half out
of his mother&rsquo;s hands, and for a moment, while they held
him together, they looked all their dismay into each
other&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand it with his
weak organ,&rdquo; said Pemberton&mdash;&ldquo;the shock, the
whole scene, the violent emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought he <i>wanted</i> to go to you!&rdquo;,
wailed Mrs. Moreen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>told</i> you he didn&rsquo;t, my dear,&rdquo; her

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
